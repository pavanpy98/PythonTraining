    "Quick sort is a divide and conquer algorithm like merge sort. It works on the principle of picking an element of the array to be sorted as a pivot and creating partitions around that pivot. The pivot element can be picked in multiple ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Picking the first element as the pivot\n",
    "- Picking the last element as the pivot\n",
    "- Random element as the pivot\n",
    "- Median as the pivot\n",
    "\n",
    "The key step in the quick sort algorithm is creating the partition. The objective of partitioning around the pivot is to place the pivot element in its correct position in the array, then placing all smaller elements of the array before it and larger elements after it.\n",
